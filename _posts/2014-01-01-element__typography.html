    <p>Since 1982, the <a href="#">Ounce of Prevention Fund</a> has persistently pursued a single goal: that all American children – particularly those born into poverty – have quality early childhood experiences in the crucial first five years of life.</p>

    <p>For more than two decades, the Ounce of Prevention Fund has been a leader in developing, innovating, and advancing high-quality, birth-to-five programs.</p>
    <p>We serve 4,000 children and families through Early Head Start and Head Start programs we fund and operate in Chicago, as well as through our network of home-visiting and doula programs throughout Illinois. Our innovative programs incorporate the latest research with proven service models to narrow the academic achievement gap faced by many vulnerable children.</p>
